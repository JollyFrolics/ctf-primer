== Reverse Engineering

Reversing finds the most important parts of software quickly and understands
them deeply. Though it is a specific and rare set of skills, there are a myriad
of ways to use the knowledge it yields. One may exploit software or fix it,
create malware or exterminate it, bypass protections or enhance them. A good
reverser understands the aspects of software that the authors did not expect
anyone else to understand, and a master reverser understands things about
software that the authors of it know nothing about.
