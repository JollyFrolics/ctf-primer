=== Symbol of the Hacker
[[shl-symbol-of-the-hacker]]

A blank, black screen and blinking cursor. Lines and lines of scrolling text
and someone in front of that screen who seemingly understands an
incomprehensible flow of information. That is the shell.

The shell has many other names: the terminal, the command prompt, bash...
Powershell, if you're looking at Windows and feeling blue. Each name has its
own nuances. But that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that there is
the interface to computing devices that nearly all people use, and then there
is the shell.

If you've come here to get a shell and don't care for much else, then you
should skip to the <<shl-get-a-shell,Get a Shell>> section. Be warned that the
shell is more powerful than the usual way of interacting with a device.
Deleting files is permanent in the shell, any file can be accessed at any
moment in the shell, and hopefully it's not far fetched to assert that those
two things are a dangerous combination.

=== Got Shell?
[[shl-got-shell]]

Using a computer or smart device happens in 1 of 2 ways:

1. Using a pointer such as a mouse, touchpad or finger to select apps or buttons
2. Using keys on a keyboard to enter simple or complex commands (the Shell)

Thankfully, there are TLA's (Three Letter Acronyms) for both of the methods
described above:

1. GUI. Pronounced "gooey," stands for Graphical User Interface
2. CLI. Sounded out: "See-El-Eye," stands for Command Line Interface

These acronyms are pretty good as far as acronyms go. We will refer to the
shell by many names, perhaps sometimes even by the CLI initialism. The GUI
doesn't have as nice of a name as the shell, so we will probably use GUI to
briefly refer to the interface that everyone knows about on computing devices
that is driven by a pointer on a screen.

=== Get a Shell

Cybersecurity is a topic that is most deeply learned by listening *and* doing.
For this reason, I advise you to create a picoCTF 2019 account at this time if
you have not already. Beyond providing 120+ security challenges in helpful
learning ramps, every picoCTF 2019 account gets a user on a Linux server, which
can only be accessed with a shell. Register here:

//TODO: add lots of screenshots!!! 
//      (Might be the first time is interacting with a shell)
https://2019game.picoctf.com/

After successfully registering, a web shell can be accessed at the URL below.
Use the same  user name and password that you registered on the picoCTF 2019
website with.

Follow the instructions to effectively login in twice, which is only needed the
first login. After that, logging in once will get you into the shell server.
