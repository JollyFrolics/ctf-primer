=== Symbol of the Hacker
[[shl-symbol-of-the-hacker]]
//TODO:put animation here of terminal prompt w blinking cursor!
//TODO:consider using hacker typer to demonstrate "flow of info"

A blank, black screen and blinking cursor. Lines and lines of scrolling text
and someone in front of that screen who seemingly understands an
incomprehensible flow of information. That is the shell.

The shell has many other names: the terminal, the command prompt, bash...
Powershell, if you're looking at Windows and feeling blue. Each name has its
own nuances. But that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that there is
the interface to computing devices that nearly all people use, and then there
is the shell.

If you've come here to get a shell and don't care for much else, then you
should skip to the <<shl-get-a-shell,Get a Shell>> section. Be warned that the
shell is more powerful than the usual way of interacting with a device.
Deleting files is permanent in the shell, any file can be accessed at any
moment in the shell, and hopefully it's not far fetched to assert that those
two things are a dangerous combination.

=== Got Shell?
[[shl-got-shell]]

Using a computer or smart device happens in 1 of 2 ways:

1. Using a pointer such as a mouse, touchpad or finger to select apps, files,
   or buttons
2. Using keys on a keyboard to enter simple or complex commands (the Shell)

Thankfully, there are TLA's (Three Letter Acronyms) for both of the methods
described above:

1. GUI. Pronounced "gooey," stands for Graphical User Interface
2. CLI. Sounded out: "See-El-Eye," stands for Command Line Interface

These acronyms are pretty good as far as acronyms go. We will refer to the
shell by many names, perhaps sometimes even by the CLI initialism. The GUI
doesn't have as nice of a name as the shell, so we will probably use GUI to
briefly refer to the interface that everyone knows about on computing devices
that is driven by a pointer on a screen.

Below is a screenshot of a shell after successful login and before the user has
typed in any commands:

In the picture above, there is a lot of empty space, and even the line of text
that exists, does not provide a lot of clarity. The situation is simpler than 
how it looks. There are only 3 pieces of information in the screenshot above,
and you would likely recognize at least one of them if it were you who logged 
on:

//      that starts to build confidence in shell
//      looks good: https://terminal.jcubic.pl/

1. `Q0h313th`
  * The user named "Q0h313th" is logged into this shell
2. `pico-2019-shell1`
  * The shell is on the computer called "pico-2019-shell1"
3. `~`
  * The shell is parked in Q0h313th's home directory on pico-2019-shell1
  * `~` is just shorthand for `/home/Q0h313th/`

=== Get a Shell
[[shl-get-a-shell]]
Cybersecurity is a topic that is most deeply learned by listening *and* doing.
For this reason, I advise you to create a picoCTF 2019 account at this time if
you have not already. Beyond providing 120+ security challenges in helpful
learning ramps, every picoCTF 2019 account gets a user on a Linux server, which
can only be accessed with a **shell**. 

A note on textbook structure: many times I will provide a high level
walkthrough for a task and also a step by step walkthrough for the same task.
This is my attempt at accomodating different learning styles, different levels
of experience or whatever else.  Typically, the high level walkthrough is more
for learners who already know the basics but need a refresher or need a
reminder about the particulars when it comes to this Primer. The step by step
walkthrough is more for learners who have never ventured in a particular sort
of task before. Of course, you must choose your own path here, but the safest
bet may be to read the high level walkthrough but actually put hands to
keyboard for the step by step walkthrough.

==== High Level Walkthrough
*Register for a picoCTF 2019 account at the link below.* You will need to
validate the email address you provide by clicking on a link that is sent to
it.

https://2019game.picoctf.com/

After successfully registering, a web shell can be accessed at the URL below.
*Use the same  user name and password that you registered on the picoCTF 2019
website to log into the shell at the link below* (or in the "Shell" tab in the
picoCTF 2019 website) For the sake of security, you will not see your password
as you type it in. *You will log in twice.* This is only for your first log
in.

https://2019game.picoctf.com/shell

You will know you've successfully logged into the shell if you see a very 
similar screen as <<first-look,Q0h313th's empty prompt>>.
