A network is made up of several computers connected. They can be connected through different protocols. A Protocol is a set of rules that allow two computers in a network to send and receive information. That set of rules is essential to understand what information is coming from what source, or how to send information to a particular computer in the network. To sniff traffic in a network, we will be using a tool called Wireshark, which can show the packets transmitted on a network and we can get passwords from insecure connections. But first, we will briefly explain some important things so you roughly understand the composition of a packet and can extract the parts you need.

When you access a browser and visit a web site, the information of the web site is downloaded in packets. Today’s Internet is fast, and you might feel that the website appears all at once. But if you download a big file, you can see that it takes some time. This happens because the file is broken down into packets that are received in your computer, and begin to accumulate, until they are all received and conform the whole file when the download is completed. Each packet contains a piece corresponding to each layer. Review the layers here: <<network_layers>>.

=== Sniffing and attack example

In a tool called Wireshark, we can “sniff” the packets transmitted on a network. The technical term that is used to refer to a tool like Wireshark is “sniffer”.

Go here for instructions on installing Wireshark if you have not already:
<<installing_wireshark>>.

Once you install and open it you should see a window similar to this:

[.text-center]
.Wireshark GUI

That is the list of devices you can sniff. In this case, we want to sniff the network card you are using to connect to the internet. If you are connected to a WiFi, you should select the one that is called “WiFi”. In case you are connected to the Internet using Ethernet cable, you should select “Ethernet”. Then, click the “start capture” button on the upper left side which is circled in the following image:

[.text-center]
.Wireshark run button

The capture now starts. If you have applications running on your computer or have website open in your browser, you will probably see several packets immediately, let the Wireshark window continue to run the packet sniffing. In your browser, navigate to the following link:

http://primer.picoctf.org/vuln/web/sign_in.php

You should see the following page:

.Sign-in page

Now come back to the Wireshark window. What we want to do now is finding the packets that were sent and received in your computer when you accessed the link. If there are too many packets from all the connections on your computer, this task would be too hard task without the help of a Wireshark filter. A Wireshark filter allows you to tell Wireshark that you only want to see some specific packets. You can filter by protocol, IP, strings present in your request, or anything you need that helps you find what you are looking for faster. When we accessed the link on the browser, we did an HTTP request. We can filter HTTP requests, by simply typing http on the filter textfield and pressing enter. The following image shows the results and we circled in red the textfield in which you have to type:

[.text-center]
.Wireshark HTTP filter
image::images/5image42.png[image,width=624,height=529]

Right below the textfield in which you typed is the packet list. We can see two packets. The first one is the request your browser sent to the server asking for the web page, so naturally it has your IP as the source, and the IP of the server as the destination. The second packet is the reply, which now has your IP as the destination and the IP of the server as the source because now the server is the one that is sending the page to you after you request it.

In the lower part of the window, we can see the information related to all the layers we explained previously of the currently selected packet. Now, we will send a user and password to the web site. This page in particular does not do anything after you send a password, it just receives it, but the important thing is to note that we can see the password on wireshark when we send it. In the web page, type the following in user and password respectively:

picouser

picopassword

In Wireshark, you should see now two more packets, one in which you send the user and password, and the reply of the server. Note that the reply of the server is the same page, as we said this page does nothing. So far, we have 4 packets, and the third one is the one in which you send the user and password!

Click the third packet, and in the lower part of the window where the layers are visible, click “Hypertext Transfer Protocol”. Note that at the end we can see &password=picopassword

[.text-center]
.Sniffed password

We just found the password we sent using sniffing. A fundamental thing to note, is that we were able to do that because the website was using HTTP, instead of HTTPS which is encrypted. Encryption prevents us from understanding the contents of a packet.

Additionally, we are always able to sniff the network card of our own computer. However, if we want to sniff packets from other devices connected to the same WIFI, we must do additional things because WiFi could be using encryption. We encourage you to use a second device, it can be a smartphone, to access the web page and send a password. Then in your computer use Wireshark to capture the password sent, but first you need to do two things:

Enable monitor mode in Wireshark: Stop any packet capture you are doing and open the capture dialog, which is located in the upper part of the window and click “options”Choose Wifi Interface and check “monitor” as in the following image:

[.text-center]
.Monitor mode on Wireshark
image::images/5image44.png[image,width=624,height=529]

IMPORTANT: When the monitor mode is enabled and you are capturing packets, you would not be able to navigate the Internet on your computer. To be able to navigate again, disable monitor mode by unchecking the checkbox.

Decrypt WiFi connection: You can do this only if you have the password for the WiFi you are sniffing. In the following link there is a very good article that explains how to do it:

https://wiki.wireshark.org/HowToDecrypt802.11[[.underline]#https://wiki.wireshark.org/HowToDecrypt802.11#]

Note that WIFI encryption is encryption of the datalink layer, which is different to the encryption provided by HTTPS which is in the application layer. Even if you decrypt the WIFI connection, if a website is using HTTPS, you will not be able to see anything from that website on Wireshark.
